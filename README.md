- yolo-v4 is my personal implementation for yolo it can achieve aroung mAP 25 withmobilenet with alpha = 1 and image size 224x224. I have taken help from other resouces available in the internet for this work.
- yolo-v8_1 is a modified version of "Ultralytics"
- For detectron2, fvcore, yolo-v5, flownet, consistant depth - I have just gathered some popular existing opensource codes of for study, modification and improvement in the future.

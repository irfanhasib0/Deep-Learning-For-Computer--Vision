- DeeplabV3
  - I have implemented UNet from scratch a while ago here ![UNet](https://github.com/irfanhasib0/CNN-Projects/blob/master/CNN_Basic/U-Net_cityscapes.ipynb)
  In this repository I am working on DeeplabV3. Here are some resuts of training on VOC Dataset. I have borrowed some code from the internet since now a days lot's of technology are coming every day. It's not practical to implement everything from scratch and stay up to date at the same time.

- YOLO-V8
  - yolo-v4 is my personal implementation for yolo it can achieve aroung mAP 25 withmobilenet with alpha = 1 and image size 224x224. I     have taken help from other resouces available in the internet for this work.

  - yolo-v8_1 is a modified version of "Ultralytics"

 - For SPADE, detectron2, flownet, consistant depth - I have just gathered some popular existing opensource code for study, modification and improvement. I have plan to work with these in the near future.

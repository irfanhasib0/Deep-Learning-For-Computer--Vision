- DeeplabV3
  - ![deeplabv3](https://github.com/irfanhasib0/Deep-Learning-For-Computer-Vision/blob/main/deeplabv3/)
  - I implemented UNet from scratch here ![UNet](https://github.com/irfanhasib0/CNN-Projects/blob/master/CNN_Basic/U-Net_cityscapes.ipynb)
  In this repository I am working on DeeplabV3. Here are some resuts of training on VOC Dataset. I have borrowed some code from the internet since now a days lot's of technology are coming every day. It's not practical to implement everything from scratch and stay up to date at the same time.

- YOLO-V8
  - yolo-v8 is a modified version of "Ultralytics"
  - ![yolo-v8](https://github.com/irfanhasib0/Deep-Learning-For-Computer-Vision/blob/main/yolo-v8/)
  - yolo-v4 is my personal implementation of yolo v4 from scratch. It can achieve aroung mAP 25 with mobilenet with alpha = 1 and image size 224x224. I have taken help from other resouces available in the internet for this work.
